CUDA and serial implementation of a genetic algorithm learning to player a game.

## Game
The game is a simple platformer.

## Algorithms
Evolution, Neural Networks, Stuff.

## Installation and Requirement
SFML and CUDA must be installed to build. CUDA is only required to run on the GPU and SFML is only required to watch a chromosome play.

```

cd build
cmake ..
make 
```
